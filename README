syno_control - utility to manage "status" led and buttons on DS207 NAS

This tool is designed to control "status" led and buttons on Synlogy DS207 NAS.
After startup tool is checking power status on HDD1 and HDD2 and if both
drives are in "standby" status - turning status led off.

Updated status and events from buttons are also logged using syslog.
If at least one of them is active - led is turned on. This is done in a loop,
every second.

Also it is possible to set status led to "orange blinking" by creating
/var/run/status-alert file. This is done for integration with external programs.
If this file is removed led is returned to normal status.

Also syno_control listening for events from USB and power buttons.If buttons
are pressed it is trying to start scripts /etc/syno/buttons/usb (for USB button)
and /etc/syno/buttons/power (for POWER button). This scripts are executed in
background mode, so syno_control is not blocked during execution.

To enable debug use -v (or -vv) switch. I am recommending to use
this tool together with hd-idle (http://hd-idle.sourceforge.net/).
