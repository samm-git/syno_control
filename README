status_led - utility to set "status" led on DS207 NAS

This tool is designed to control "status" led on Synlogy DS207 NAS.
After startup tool is checking power status on HDD1 and HDD2 and if 
both drives are in "standby" status - turning status led off.
Updated status is also logged using syslog. If at least one of them 
is active - led is turned on. This is done in a loop, every second.

Also it is possible to set status led to "orange blinking" by creating
/var/run/status-alert file. This is done for integration with external
programs. If this file is removed led is returned to normal status.

To enable debug use -v (or -vv) switch. I am recommending to use
this tool together with hd-idle (http://hd-idle.sourceforge.net/).
